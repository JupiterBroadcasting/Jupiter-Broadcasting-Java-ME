Jupiter Broadcating JavaME App
==========

Its an app to let you view shows from http://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com

This is a netbeans java ME project. Its mainly designed for my Sony Ericsson P1i phone but should work on the other 30% of all the phones in world that run JavaME.
Also think this is the first JB app for symbian. 

To install get both the jad and jar files from the dist folder onto your phone and open the jad file

Upcoming features:

* Live Stream 

* MP3/Ogg Feed

Notes on anyone wanting to contribute:

* Using 4 tabs instead of \t character as is netbeans default

* Use standard java style guide

* If you have a patch and it makes sense. I'll take it but please justify your patches.
