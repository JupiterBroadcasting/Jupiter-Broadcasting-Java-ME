Jupiter Broadcating JavaME App
==========

Its an app to let you view shows from http://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com

This is a netbeans java ME project. Its mainly designed for my Sony Ericsson P1i phone but should work on the other 30% of all the phones in world that run JavaME.
Also think this is the first JB app for symbian. 

If anyone wants to read about its development of get any of my other apps got to http://www.softwareontheside.info

To install get both the jad and jar files from the dist folder onto your phone and open the jad file

### Fetures:


* Youtube feed to play videos

* Mp3 Feed to download mp3's

	* Categorized Show Feeds for Mp3's

### Upcoming features/To Do:

* Clean up threading because at this stage deadlock may occur but that's a probelm for the morning ;P

* File Browser for older downloads

* Live Stream (This is starting to seem like its not going to happen)

* Ogg Feed 

### Notes on anyone wanting to contribute:


* Using 4 spaces as tabs instead of \t character because this is the netbeans default.

* [Use standard java style guide](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconv-138413.html)

* If you have a patch and it makes sense. I'll take it but please justify your patches.
